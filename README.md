# axios_intelligent_interceptor
while handling backend api with axios that will be efficiently useful middleware to intercept requests and responses, allowing for centralized handling of common tasks like adding headers, handling errors, or modifying request/response data

# Installation 

npm install axios

# Advantages of using interceptors 

- 1st thing first I want to tell about advantage of using interceptor is we don't need to setup configuration that includes headers and token and timeout in every htpps call .
- We can handle errors or other things like token refresh and response handling once in interceptor and don't need to repeat that will help for better experience in maintenance.
